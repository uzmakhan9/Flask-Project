# Flask-Project
This is my First Flask Project in which I made a Responsive Todo App using Flask Python Framework.
Using this Todo App, we can create our Todo List and perform CRUD Operation (Create, Read, Update & Delete).
In this Flask App, first I used Flask Default Server for the Development Purpose and then for Delpoyment Purpose, I used Heroku to deploy it.
I used basic Html, CSS Style Sheets and some of the Bootstrap Classes for the Front-End of this Flask Project.
For Back-End, I used the Default Database Connectivity of Flask-SQLALchemy.
